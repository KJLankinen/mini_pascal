This is a repository for a compiler written in Rust. The compiler accepts a Pascal-like language called mini Pascal as input and it outputs WebAssembly,
if the input program was accepted.

The compiler contains a scanner, a parser, a semantic analyzer, a stacker and a wasmer. No optimizations are done to the input code.
